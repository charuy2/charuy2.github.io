    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>
      Hi everyone, I'm Charu. I'm a highschooler who is passionate and driven and looking forward to using my interests in serving my community. I'm hardworking and am willing to push myself in order to explore new situations and take advantage of opportunities available to me. I'm passionate about creating as I'm an artist and an aspiring programmer, and some things that I do as I create is listen to different types of music. A few other things I enjoy doing are biking with my friends, eating good food, and roller skating. I'm excited to share some of my passions with you!
